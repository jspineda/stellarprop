## Here I include the stellar sequences presented in Pineda et al. 2021b

Each file includes columns for mass array, and median of GP ensemble regression curves. The `lb' and `ub' columns denote the bounds for the central 68% confidence interval

TMGPSeq.csv -- Effective Temperature (K) as a function of Mass (solar units)
LTGPSeq.csv -- log_10 of bolometric luminosity relative to solar as function of Effective Temperature (K) 
LMGPSeq.csv -- log_10 of bolometric luminosity relative to solar as function of Mass (solar units)

For the derivative sequences, the median and confidence bound curves are determine from the GP predictions for the derivative curves. 

DerivTMGPSeq.csv -- Derivative of Effective Temperature with respect to mass (K / Jupiter-Mass) as a function of Mass (solar units)
DerivLMGPSeq.csv -- Derivative of log_10 of bolometric luminosity relative to solar (dex / Jupiter-Mass) as function of Mass (solar units)
